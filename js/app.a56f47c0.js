Scattered about you can be seen a pile of bottles (all of them empty), a nursery of young beanstalks murmuring quietly, a bed of oysters, a bundle of black rods with rusty stars on their ends, and a collection of brass lanterns.  Off to one side a great many dwarves are sleeping on the floor, snoring loudly.  A sign nearby reads:  \\"DO NOT DISTURB THE DWARVES!\\"  An immense mirror is hanging against one wall, and stretches to the other end of the room, where various other sundry objects can be glimpsed dimly in the distance.","short":"You\'re at NE end.","lighted":true,"q":115},{"name":"swend","description":"You are at the southwest end of the repository.  To one side is a pit full of fierce green snakes.  On the other side is a row of small wicker cages, each of which contains a little sulking bird.  In one corner is a bundle of black rods with rusty marks on their ends. A large number of velvet pillows are scattered about on the floor. A vast mirror stretches off to the northeast.  At your feet is a large steel grate, next to which is a sign that reads, \\"TREASURE VAULT.  KEYS IN MAIN OFFICE.\\"","short":"You\'re at SW end.","lighted":true,"q":116},{"name":"view","description":"You are on the edge of a breath-taking view. Far below you is an active volcano, from which great gouts of molten lava come surging out, cascading back down into the depths.  The glowing rock fills the farthest reaches of the cavern with a blood-red glare, giving every-thing an eerie, macabre appearance.  The air is filled with flickering sparks of ash and a heavy smell of brimstone.  The walls are hot to the touch, and the thundering of the volcano drowns out all other sounds.  Embedded in the jagged roof far overhead are myriad twisted formations, composed of pure white alabaster, which scatter the murky light into sinister apparitions upon the walls.  To one side is a deep gorge, filled with a bizarre chaos of tortured rock that seems to have been crafted by the Devil himself.  An immense river of fire crashes out from the depths of the volcano, burns its way through the gorge, and plummets into a bottomless pit far off to your left.  To the right, an immense geyser of blistering steam erupts continuously from a barren island in the center of a sulfurous lake, which bubbles ominously.  The far right wall is aflame with an incandescence of its own, which lends an additional infernal splendor to the already hellish scene.  A dark, foreboding passage exits to the south.","short":"You\'re at breath-taking view.","lighted":true,"q":126}]')},ad80:function(e,t,n){},df3c:function(e){e.exports=JSON.parse('{"motions":["in","out","enter","down","downstream","up","north","south","west","east","take","drop","on","off","score","pit","look","info","help","xyzzy","yes","no","quit"],"locations":["road","house","valley","hill","forest","slit","outside","inside","cobbles","debris","awk","bird","spit","shell","nugget","hall"],"objects":["rug","food","bottle","keys","lamp","grate","grate_","cage","clam"]}')},f230:function(e,t,n){"use strict";n("7fdb")}});
