To get full credit for a treasure, you must have left it safely in the building, though you get partial credit just for locating it.  You lose points for getting killed, or for quitting, though the former costs you more. There are also points based on how much (if any) of the cave you've managed to explore; in particular, there is a large bonus just for getting in (to distinguish the beginners from the rest of the pack), and there are other ways to determine whether you've been through some of the more harrowing sections.  If you think you've found all the treasures, just keep exploring for a while.  If nothing interesting happens, you haven't found them all yet.  If something interesting DOES happen, it means you're getting a bonus and have an opportunity to garner many more points in the master's section. I may occasionally offer hints if you seem to be having trouble. If I do, I'll warn you in advance how much it will affect your score to accept the hints.

To move, try words like forest, building, downstream, enter, east, west, north, south, up, or down.  I know about a few special objects, like a black rod hidden in the cave.  These objects can be manipulated using some of the action words that I know.  Usually you will need to give both the object and action words (in either order), but sometimes I can infer the object from the verb alone.  Some objects also imply verbs; in particular, \"inventory\" implies \"take inventory\", which causes me to give you a list of what you're carrying.  The objects have side effects; for instance, the rod scares the bird.  Usually people having trouble moving just need to try a few more words.  Usually people trying unsuccessfully to manipulate an object are attempting something beyond their (or my!) capabilities and should try a completely different tack.  To speed the game you can sometimes move long distances with a single word.  For example, \"building\" usually gets you to the building from anywhere above ground except when lost in the forest.  Also, note that cave passages turn a lot, and that leaving a room to the north does not guarantee entering the next from the south.",
